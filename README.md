Crayon-Twilight Colour scheme for gedit
=======================================

Gedit includes several different color schemes, allowing you to change the appearance of the main text window (but none of them was appealing for me). But! I saw a color scheme at http://ak.net84.net, so I mixed it to the default colour scheme called twilight. Hope you'll like the outcome.

To change the color scheme in gedit, complete the following steps:

	* Select Edit ▸ Preferences ▸ Font & Colors.
	* Choose your desired color scheme.
	* The new color scheme will be applied immediately.
 
Have fun, and as always: the content comes with no warranty. If you messed up something it's on you. Sorry.
